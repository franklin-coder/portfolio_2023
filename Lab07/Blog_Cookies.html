                    <h1>Should Digital Cookies Be Regulated?</h1>
			 
                    <p class="mb-4" >Could the internet spy on users’ privacy? Currently, the internet has turned into a vital tool in
                        human beings’ daily routines, even for those who don't use it. Although it can bring a lot of
                        benefits helping to solve almost any process from school or work task up to make friends or find
                        the next wife, the last decade the use the internet has risen to 70 % between 1990 and 2016
                        worldwide, showing for example that 98 % of Iceland’s population has used the internet, while
                        African countries with 20 % of the average consumption and the global total of users in 2016
                        depict 3.408 billion(Roser et al., 2015). However, there are some doubts to figure out, for
                        example, why the internet has personal information from internet surfers like passwords or buys
                        preferences, and how can it take that kind of information? Or where is put the data?Despite that
                        cyberspace is known as an essential service nowadays, unfortunately, it can also be found some
                        risks due to this technology bringing additional elements to work more efficiently, although the
                        first email was sent in the 1960s, later in the 1970s the first file was able to be sent it,
                        after that in 1982 internet began the, however in 1989 Tim Berners-Lee a British scientist
                        changed the way people communicated forever creating the relevant impact and expansion endless
                        yet (Roser et al., 2015). Despite this positive aspect, another group of individuals believes
                        that features such as digital cookies can compromise online privacy and security.The term
                        "cookie" refers to a small file containing a unique identifier that sends users' information
                        from web servers to browsers as a piece of text, which is sometimes saved on the hard disk. This
                        process can help to improve the website's usability, but it can also make browsing the internet
                        feel unreliable. Although many websites today use "cookies" to remember passwords and usernames
                        and track which sites a user visits (Hewlett-Packard Company, 2018).Many internet users, on the
                        other hand, are concerned about the use of cookies to track their browsing habits. These
                        concerned individuals are beginning to see cookies as an invasion of privacy (Xu & Zhang, 2016).
                        As a result, the topic of this essay will be whether or not cookies should be regulated to
                        protect users' privacy and personal data on the internet.
                        Although three types of cookies were developed to improve the user experience: persistent,
                        first-party, and third-party cookies, each of which can provide a certain level of security,
                        there is also a cookie known as a super cookie that can obtain user data such as passwords and
                        last websites visited while browsing the internet and send it to a different server (Xu & Zhang,
                        2016),although any case has been confirmed about identity fraud by digital cookies, it could be
                        a huge opportunity to do it, and when someone tries to keep records or use tracking devices on
                        others, privacy concerns arise(Miller, 2001).</p>

                            <p>For instance,unfortunately,some advertisement
                        banners can hold active despite it having been closed, and often it can be seen when the net is
                        browsed those special announcements requiring permissions to continue exploring on the website
                        that it usually can skip the enjoyer’s security analysis before allowing it by a quick click. An
                        example, in 2009, was regulated in The European Union the use of cookies on European websites. A
                        cookie cannot be placed unless the user has been informed about its purpose and how it works.
                        Although a unique exception could be when cookies were required for the users directly to access
                        the service, such as on an e-commerce website(Roser et al., 2015). In a brief, while cookies
                        have been shown as safe, finally super cookies make less reliable in terms to safeguard the
                        confidentiality
                        Cookies were thought to enhance the user experience, and also contribute boost the digital
                        marketing showing the correct information to the target interested that it would become the
                        experience more friendly to navigate on the internet. (Kaspersky, n. d).at the same time, it can
                        be seen that the evidence about spoofing or fraud has been nothing like an official
                        reportbillion (Roser et al., 2015). This can increase the welfare during the connection time
                        make browsing a lot more enjoyable, for example, Persistent cookies are also used to track which
                        websites a user visits, allowing advertisers to target ads to specific users. So the adult ads
                        will not be shown to children or a young sportsman will not see a banner about how to change
                        babies(Floridi, 2008). This type of cookies has been used by famous and significant branches in
                        the top five it can be seen Google, Facebook, Adobe, Twitter, and Microsoft(Dimitrov, 2021). In
                        addition, cookies can be managed by the internet surfer doing a specific process In the browser.
                        Therefore, analyzing the benefits would be reasonable not to regulate the cookies.</p>

                             <p> In my opinion, every single development brings drawbacks, although it can be seen more benefit
                            not only for people that spend time looking for something or having a good time otherwise
                            marketing companies and e-commerce can benefited from this features taking advantage collecting
                            the information and then putting in the correct market-making everything almost perfect, for
                            example when someone is looking for shoes and keep on shoe e-commerce, but in online shopping
                            cart decided not to buy the product and the labels were filled up, however, a minute later
                            customer comes back to the shop, the filling-up process would not have to do
                            again(Hewlett-Packard Company, 2018).finally, in my opinion, it would be necessary to implement
                            more campaigns for engaging the user to know how to deny access to malicious cookies.
    
                            To conclude cookies help customers and companies to find each other conveniently and offer
                            depending on the likelihoods and history in the web showing the relevant data that customers are
                            looking for the most cases according ….. however, The solution could be to teach the user in a
                            friendly way how to manage easilyby themselves having more ethic (Floridi, 2008). Therefore,
                            cookies should not be regulated.
