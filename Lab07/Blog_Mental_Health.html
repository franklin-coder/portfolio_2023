                <h1>The Efficiency of Gardening vs Meditation for Mental and Physical Health</h1>
                <p>Currently, the word "stress" has become more common in recent years. This has been considered nowadays as one of the most relevant aspects of mental and physical health at any age or socioeconomic background. It does not matter where people are located; it can be possible to experiment with stress due to some situations like dangerous moments, loneliness, financial difficulties, etc. Cortisol levels might rise, and as a consequence, stress can manifest in the body or mind. This can increase the risk of suffering mental and immunological issues, heart disease, body aches, and so much more (Croteau 2019, March 27). Although some options could be a solution to treat these mental and physical issues in traditional medicine, there is a strong trend in a group of individuals considering natural and ancestral techniques as an efficient way to improve stress rates. Despite sports, talking, and walking around having been used as possible ways to fight to keep physical and mental well-being, meditation and gardening have gained high recognition as convenient options because it can be seen that cortisol can increase up to 9 times in stress in comparison to being relaxed, and both techniques share the same objective of keeping calm (Cay, 2018). While a study confirms that after 30 minutes of enjoying simple garden activities like just looking at the environment or walking around, there was a reduction in cortisol levels. Moreover, it can be a replacement for a gym if people do not like it (Cay, 2018). On the other hand, meditation shows that after 26 to 52 weeks of practice, people feel better about their backaches than those who received standard care, and it may help maintain blood pressure stability (Thorsen, 2009). However, it is necessary to analyze both options based on the cost of doing them and how people can keep them.</p>

                        <p>Speaking of cost, even though these methods could have a strong relationship in terms of helping figure out issues related to mental health and some aches in the body without traditional medicine. However, meditation looks like a possibility with unlimited sources as digital as physics. For example, there are uncounted apps, websites, and blogs like Calm, Headspace, and Insight Timer offering the option to practice at any time or any age, even any place. These platforms are teaching how meditation can be practiced alone. In addition, organizations like the Royal College of Physicians and others are giving online sessions where it is possible to learn meditation for free (Behan, 2020).While gardening looks less affordable, although there is a lot of free information that can be found on the internet about horticulture, it could have more limitations in terms of cost because it is necessary to buy some elements to start, for instance, special land depending on the type of plant, recipients, and even some nutrients to grow correctly, this cost could start from 1 to 40 dollar depending on the type of plant to start. Tomatoes, carrots, and baby spinach can share similar conditions to be cultivated, however, each one shows different prices for materials tomatoes $1.85/lb, spinach $2.00/lb, and carrots pound $2.00/lb. Although some gardens can bring economic benefits, such as not paying gym membershipsthat could cost $50 and paying less for some vegetables that can be cultivated by gardening(Athearnet al., n.d). In either case, practicing meditation does not require paying anything. The mandatory elements are body-mind, and concentration. This method also provides access to a free source during the learning process. On the other hand, gardening can be seen as a habit that can improve mental and physical issues through relaxation, however, in any case, planting requires investing at least $2 USD on average per pound as can be seen in the prices above(Athearnet al., n.d).</p>

                         <p>Although both techniques require time to obtain results, there is also a relationship between the types of issues that can be treated through them. However, there are some differences between aspects like sustainability and accessibility. In terms of time, it can be found that while meditation can take between twenty minutes and an hour for an average session, a study shows that after twenty-six weeks, individuals can reduce the pain in their backs (National Center of Complementary and Integrative Health, 2006). While cultivation, after thirty minutes of doing simple gardening activities, for example, taking in the sunlight or looking at nature, can help to feel higher welfare. It can also encourage isolated or dementia patients to interact socially, improving communication and reducing these pathologies(Thompson, 2018). Analyzing the positive impact on the environment and quality of life, each method has positive and negative aspects. However, meditation is helpful for each individual because the major idea is to concentrate. Planting, on the other hand, offers a higher range of possibilities to interact with others throughout conversations between gardening fans. Besides, planting could provide fruit and vegetables as a possibility to cultivate, which could impact eating habits and increase the quality of life through a healthy diet(Thompson, 2018). At the same time, engage the patients in a little exercise routine by digging or moving, helping them lose calories. Therefore, gardening shows more quick improvements in mental issues than meditation. In addition, it can also be seen as stimulation to acquire a healthy diet through some fresh vegetables, and it combines physical and mental exercise. It can also bring economic benefits by requiring fewer fruits and greens from grocery stores (Thompson, 2018).

                         To sum up, meditation and gardening can indeed help to decrease the risk of some diseases related to mental and physical health(Schender, 2012). However, meditation provides some options for paying affordable prices, and even some resources can be found for free on the internet, so, therefore, meditation can be seen as more accessible than horticulture in terms of cost, with the possibility of not paying anything to start(Behan, 2020). On the other hand, although gardening can look more expensive in the beginning, at the same time, it could bring more benefits, for example, engaging patients in a little exercise routine as part of the process and stimulating social interaction in dementia patients through conversations between planting fans. In addition, it can be seen that there is an increase in feelings of welfare after 30 minutes of doing simple activities like walking or looking around(Cay, 2018). It could mean less effort than trying to keep concentrated. Besides, planting could help acquire a healthy diet using some vegetables. To conclude, although meditation has demonstrated some significant benefits, a study shows a higher difficulty in keeping this practice in the long term, even though it can be seen that some users usually do not practice outside of classes(Behan, 2020).While gardening needs more investigation to support how many individuals can keep doing it for a long time. Planting can also improve social interaction, stimulate exercise routines, and offer healthy food in comparison with meditation showing bemore efficientfor mental and physical health than meditationwith higher options to obtain results in a shorter time and less effort to enroll and keep it.
